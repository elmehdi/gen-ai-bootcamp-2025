# gen-ai-bootcamp-2025
Gen AI Bootcamp 2025 is a hands-on AI learning experience focused on building intelligent applications for language learning. Over six weeks, I'll develop AI-driven tools to enhance a Spanish  Language Learning School's platform, applying NLP, ASR, and other AI techniques.

# GenAI Bootcamp 2025

Welcome to my repository for the **GenAI Bootcamp 2025**! This repo will serve as a central place for my projects, notes, and exercises throughout the bootcamp.

## 📌 Bootcamp Overview

This bootcamp is designed to help participants at all levels—Beginner to Expert—to develop real-world **Generative AI** (GenAI) skills. It follows a **Maturity Model** approach:

- **Level 100**: AI-powered assistants and prompt engineering
- **Level 200**: AI as a Service, Cloud Services, Langchain, and local AI agents
- **Level 300**: Training, optimization, and quantization of models
- **Level 400**: Deploying AI models for production and compute rightsizing

## 📆 Time Commitment

| Task | Estimated Time |
|------|--------------|
| Prerequisite Knowledge | 10 hours |
| Setting Up Accounts | 2 hours |
| Classroom Sessions | 18 hours |
| Homework | 24-60 hours |
| Student Discussions | 6 hours |
| **Total Estimated Time** | **54-90 hours** |

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To follow along with the bootcamp, I will be using the following tools and platforms:

- **Programming**: Python, PyTorch, React, Tailwind CSS, GitHub
- **Cloud Services**: AWS, Azure, GCP, Intel Tiber Developer Cloud, CIVO
- **Development Tools**: GitHub Codespaces, Gitpod, MongoDB, Vercel/v0, Hugging Face

📢 *The full list of required technologies will be provided later.*
