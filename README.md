# GenAI Bootcamp 2025
Welcome to my repository for the **GenAI Bootcamp 2025**! This repo will serve as a central place for my projects, notes, and exercises throughout the bootcamp.

Gen AI Bootcamp 2025 is a hands-on AI learning experience focused on building intelligent applications for language learning. Over six weeks, I'll develop AI-driven tools to enhance a Spanish Language Learning School's platform, applying NLP, ASR, and other AI techniques.


## 📌 Bootcamp Overview

This bootcamp is designed to help participants at all levels—Beginner to Expert—to develop real-world **Generative AI** (GenAI) skills. It follows a **Maturity Model** approach:

- **Level 100**: AI-powered assistants and prompt engineering
- **Level 200**: AI as a Service, Cloud Services, Langchain, and local AI agents
- **Level 300**: Training, optimization, and quantization of models
- **Level 400**: Deploying AI models for production and compute rightsizing
